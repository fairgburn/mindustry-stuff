Unorganized collection of programs I use frequently or think could potentially be useful. Decided to share because it makes the game more fun and a lot of people don't have the time or interest to learn an assembly language to automate a video game. 

As of 12/30/2023 these are all intended to be used on one microprocessor to control one unit, nothing too fancy.  
The jumps that skip rebinding if `@unit` is null could be removed to make a processor control *every* instance of a particular unit type, but depending on the workload a cheap microprocessor might not cut it there. 

I didn't attempt to go back and improve or optimize anything as I learned more about the language, but these are so simple it doesn't really matter.
